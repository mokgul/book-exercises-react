# 📘 React Book Exercises

A personal learning repository containing **React exercises, examples, and notes**
collected while working through programming books.

Each book is organized into its own folder, typically structured by
chapter, topic, or concept.

## 🗂 Repository Structure

- Each top-level folder represents a **single book**
- Inside each book folder:
  - Chapters or topics are grouped into subfolders
  - Exercises are implemented as small, focused projects or files
- This repository prioritizes **clarity and learning**, not production-ready code
